## Hi there! 👋

# 🚀 About Me
😃 My name is Hidayah Rizki Ramadhan, an aspiring Data Scientist and Product Manager with extensive experiences in the business-side of Tokopedia, JD.ID, and Setoko.

🎓 I earned my Bachelor Degree in Business Management studies at Institut Teknologi Bandung. Although my background is in business, I am excited to learn other more technical fields such as data and product.

👨‍💻 Currently, I am gradually learning to use Python and PostgreSQL in the field of Data and Product. While doing so, I also open for various freelancing opportunities to practice my skills and building my portfolio.

🎸 Outside the world of working, I love to do some investing in various financial instruments, video-editing for lo-fi music videos, and solving chess puzzle. Oh! I also love reading books on personal development & financial literacy.
