# Hi there! 👋

## 🚀 About Me

😃 My name is Hidayah Rizki Ramadhan, a Senior Data Analyst and an aspiring Data Engineer with extensive experience in various companies such as Tokopedia, CT Corp Digital, Titipaja, CIFOR-ICRAF, and Wagely.

🎓 I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Business Management at Institut Teknologi Bandung. Although my background is in business, I am excited to learn other more technical fields such as business intelligence and data engineering.

👨‍💻 Currently, I work full-time as a Senior Data Analyst at Wagely. I am open to various freelancing opportunities to practice my skills and build my portfolio during my free time.

🎸 Outside the world of work, I love to invest in various financial instruments and practice martial arts. Oh! I also love reading books on personal development & financial literacy.
