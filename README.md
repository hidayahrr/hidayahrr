# Hi there! 👋

## 🚀 About Me

😃 My name is Hidayah Rizki Ramadhan, an aspiring Data Analyst and Product Manager with extensive experiences in the business-side of Tokopedia, JD.ID, and Setoko.

🎓 I earned my Bachelor Degree in Business Management studies at Institut Teknologi Bandung. Although my background is in business, I am excited to learn other more technical fields such as data and product.

👨‍💻 Currently, I am gradually learning to use Python, SQL, and PowerBI. While doing so, I also open for various freelancing opportunities to practice my skills and building my portfolio.

🎸 Outside the world of working, I love to do some investing in various financial instruments, video-editing for lo-fi music videos, and solving chess puzzle. Oh! I also love reading books on personal development & financial literacy.
