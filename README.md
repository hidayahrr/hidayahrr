# Hi there! 👋

## 🚀 About Me

😃 My name is Hidayah Rizki Ramadhan, an aspiring Product Manager and Data Analyst with extensive experiences in tech companies such as Tokopedia, CT Corp Digital, and Titipaja.

🎓 I earned my Bachelor Degree in Business Management studies at Institut Teknologi Bandung. Although my background is in business, I am excited to learn other more technical fields such as product management and data.

👨‍💻 Currently, I work full-time as a Product Analyst at Titipaja. During my free time, I open for various freelancing opportunities to practice my skills and building my portfolio.

🎸 Outside the world of working, I love to do some investing in various financial instruments and practicing martial arts. Oh! I also love reading books on personal development & financial literacy.
